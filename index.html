			<h2>About</h2>
	  	<p>Hi, I'm Jade. I'm a corporate project manager turned budding programmer.  I grew up in Northwestern Pennsylvania, and attended Emerson College in Boston. After braving seven harsh winters in Boston, my partner, Evan, and I decided it was time for our inevitable move to the Bay Area.  We've been here since early 2012 and are loving every minute of it! 
			</p>
			<p>
			My interest in tech/coding comes from the widespread exposure I've had to the industry, as most of our friends are programmers, or at least work in some aspect of the field.  After hearing so much about programming, I've decided to give it a try. After just a few weeks of exploration and learning, I was able to make this site. I'm really enjoying the learning process.</p>

	  	<p>Other than learning to code, which has taken up most of my time lately, I also love to cook and enjoy hosting friends for elaborate holiday meals.  I've also recently been interested in learning calligraphy, at which I am absolutely terrible! Other hobbies of mine include long-distance walking (my current record is Boston to Iowa, which is approximately 1,800 miles), weekend trips to the park with our rescue dog, a yorkie mix named Pip, and traveling anytime I get the opportunity.</p></div>
